<h1>MattBot - Your Friendly Discord Companion/h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This is a personal bot of mine that sends messages to your server's chatroom based on python. As of now, the bot is able to send a random pickup line or send a random anime GIF (based on 'reaction' command). Playing music in a voice channel is currently available; however, it is still in progress.
